proof:  
If n(x) is a positive binary integer,it is obviously that the most-significant bit can be repeated in all the extra bits.    
For a nagetive binary integer:    
$\because$ Positional Notation $$N(x)=\sum{i=1}^{k}b_{i}2^{i-1}$$  
$\because$ Two's complement $$N(x)=2^{x}-x$$where k is the number of bits for an integer,and $$N'(x)=2^{m}-x$$where $$m>k$$   
$\therefore$ $$N'(x)=2^{m}-x=(2^{m}-2^{k})+2^{k}-x=(2^{m}-1)-(2^{k}-1)+N(x)$$
$\because$ $$2^{m}-1=(2-1)\sum{i=1}^{m}2^{i-1}$$,that is m bits 1.so the same,$$2^{k}-1$$ is k bits 1.
$\therefore$If N(x) is a nagetive binary inreger,the most-significant bit can be repeated in all the extra bits.    
proof:    
$\because$ $$b^{n}-1=(b-1)\sum{i=1}^{n}b^{i-1}   
$\therefore$ $$2^{n}-1=\sum{i=1}^{n}2^{i-1}  
$\because$ For a k bits' binary integer, the sum of the inverse of each bit of the binary bit and the k bits' binary integer itself is that$$2^{k}-1=\sum{i=1}^{n}2^{i-1}$$   
Add 1 and get that$$2^{k}=\sum{i=1}^{n}2^{i-1}+1=(x)_{2}+complement of (x)_{2}+1    
$\therefore$complement of $$(x)_{2}+1=2^{k}-(x)_{2}$$   
$\because$ Representation of negative numbers in computer (binary)$$(-x)_{2}=2^{k}-(x)_{2}$$    
$\therefore$ $$(-x)_{2}=complement of (x)_{2}+1
