int_8 c = a + 3;  
1）Write your assembly code & machine code      
mov  dword  ptr [a],1  
mov eax,dword ptr [a]
mov dword ptr [c],eax

2）Explain machine code execution with the  fetch-decode-execute cycle   

3）Explain functions about  IR, PC, ACC registers in a CPU        

4）Explain physical meaning about vars a & c in a machine       

## 2、简答题
1）What are stored in memory?     
CPU中的运算数据，以及与硬盘等外部存储器交换的数据     
2）Can a data or a instruction stored in the same place?      
可以         
3） Explain Instruction Format with example instructions.   
操作码和操作数，操作码决定要完成的操作，操作数指参加运算的数据及其所在的单元地址。
000XZZZZ  bbbbbbbb 
ZZZZ是操作码，bbbbbbbb是操作数


## 3、解释以下词汇
1）汇编语言（Assembly Language）     
An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.      
Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture and operating system. In contrast, most high-level programming languages are generally portable across multiple architectures but require interpreting or compiling. Assembly language may also be called symbolic machine code.

2）编译（Compiler）  
A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program. A compiler can also be used to convert computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. Technically compilers are a type of translator that support digital devices, primarily computers.

3）命令式语言（Imperative programming）    
In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.          
The term is often used in contrast to declarative programming, which focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying how the program should achieve the result.          
4）函数编程语言（Functional programming）    
In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x produces the same result f(x) each time; this is in contrast to procedures depending on a local or global state, which may produce different results at different times when called with the same arguments but a different program state. Eliminating side effects, i.e., changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs, can make it much easier to understand and predict the behavior of a program, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming.       
5）过程式编程（Procedural programming）     
Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself. The first major procedural programming languages first appeared circa 1960, including Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL and BASIC. Pascal and C were published closer to the 1970s.        
Computer processors provide hardware support for procedural programming through a stack register and instructions for calling procedures and returning from them. Hardware support for other types of programming is possible, but no attempt was commercially successful .
