## 4、What mean secondary storage. List some on your PC.
辅助存储器，也称为辅助存储器, 二次存储, 二次存储器或外部存储器，是一个非易失性存储器(当设备关闭时不会丢失存储的数据)CPU无法直接访问的数据，因为它不能通过输入/输出通道(它是外部设备)访问。在RAM设备(如闪存)中，数据可以直接删除或更改。       

闪存, 光盘, 磁碟和磁带。

## 5、使用维基百科，解释以下概念： 
CPU:  
A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since the early 1960s. Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.

RAM:     
Random-access memory  is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. In contrast, with other direct-access data storage media such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory, the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.

ROM:   
Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM can only be modified slowly, with difficulty, or not at all, so it is mainly used to store firmware (software that is closely tied to specific hardware, and unlikely to need frequent updates) or application software in plug-in cartridges.

Bus (computing):       
In computer architecture, a bus (a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. This expression covers all related hardware components (wire, optical fiber, etc.) and software, including communication protocols.

Parallel Computing :      
Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has long been employed in high-performance computing, but it's gaining broader interest due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years,parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.

## 6、写一段文字，简单解释“云计算（cloud computing）”
云计算是可配置的计算机系统资源和更高级服务的共享池，这些资源可以通过最少的管理工作快速提供，通常通过因特网。云计算依赖于资源共享来实现一致性和规模经济，类似于公用事业。 

## 7、小孙买了计算机主板，说明书表明“支持双通道DDR3-1333内存， 最大支持16G” 
1）DDR3内存，“3”和“1333”的含义是什么？      
“3”指第三代；“1333”是指内存等效频率。          
2）小孙买8G DDR3-1600的内存能提高性能吗？       
能。      
3）小孙买4G*2 DDR3-1333的内存能提高性能吗？         
不能。     
4）16G需要多少位地址？ 备注，维基百科（中文）“DDR3 SDRAM”       
\(2^34\)位
