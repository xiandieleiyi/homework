## 使用维基百科，解释以下概念。
### 1. Method of complements
In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in mechanical calculators and is still used in modern computers. 
### 2. Byte
The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures. 
### 3. Integer(computer science)
Jump to search
In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers. Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values. Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits (bits). The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers. Computer hardware, including virtual machines, nearly always provide a way to represent a processor register or memory address as an integer. 
### 4. Floating Point
Sam Shepherd is an English electronic musician and neuroscientist, who records and performs music under the name Floating Points. Shepherd is also a co-founder of the label Eglo Records. 
After several EPs, singles and live appearances, Shepherd released Floating Points' debut studio album, Elaenia, in November 2015, to widespread critical acclaim.
## 1)请证明：二进制的负数（two‘s complement of X）等于 X 的 ones’ complement  ＋ 1（即，X每位求反加1） 
给定一组所有可能的n位值，我们可以将下半部分（通过二进制值）指定为0到（2^(n-1)-1）包含的整数，上半部分指定为-2^(n-1)到-1包含的整数。上半部分（同样，通过二进制值）可以用来表示从-2^(n-1)到-1的负整数，因为在加法模2^n下，它们的行为与那些负整数相同。也就是说，因为i+j mod 2^n=i+(j+2^n)mod 2^n，所以集合{j+k-2^n|k中的任何值都是整数}都可以用来代替j。             
例如，用八位，无符号字节是0到255。从上半部分减去256（128到255）产生符号字节128到1。              
通过注意256＝255＋1，和（255×x）是x的补码来实现与二元补码的关系。 
## 2))Int8_t x = - 017; 请用8进制描述变量 x。在c中017即(017)8
二进制 ：11110001 ；
八进制 ：761 。
## C程序：int8_t  x = -0x1f;  int y = x;  请用16进制描述变量 x 和 y，并说明 int y = x 的计算过程。 
x = -0x1f，转换为十进制数为-31.而-31的原码表示为1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 1111，最高位为符号位（1为负数，0为非负数）。保持原码符号位不变，其余为取反后再加1即可得到其补码表示1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1110 0001，然后把该二进制数转换为十六进制可得到0xffffffe1。
##  NaN 是什么？
In computing, NaN, standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations. Systematic use of NaNs was introduced by the IEEE 754 floating-point standard in 1985, along with the representation of other non-finite quantities like infinities. 
Two separate kinds of NaNs are provided, termed quiet NaNs and signaling NaNs. Quiet NaNs are used to propagate errors resulting from invalid operations or values, whereas signaling NaNs can support advanced features such as mixing numerical and symbolic computation or other extensions to basic floating-point arithmetic. For example, 0/0 is undefined as a real number, and so represented by NaN; the square root of a negative number is imaginary, and thus not representable as a real floating-point number, and so is represented by NaN; and NaNs may be used to represent missing values in computations.
